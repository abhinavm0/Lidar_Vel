# Lidar_VelMorgan HillPlease find 3 .m files:1) A_RADAR.m2) B_AWGN.m3) C_KALMAN_filter.m1) A is not complete but shows the functions written to replace the phased LIDAR toolbox functions. As I do not have this toolbox, I could not verify the outputs except for the peak power.Also, design the actual antenna is beyond my skill set where I stopped in this project.2) B also shows the different intermediate functions required to generate the GN.However, I stopped where I needed the optimization toolbox for fmaximin function.3) C is compete as running the program will show the KALMAN filter working and the encoder frequency being correctly detected.The plots basically reproduce the results in the referenced paper.
